Name
	etcproxy - a TCP proxy in Erlang for various testing purpose.

Description
	This proxy is useful for various network-related tests. It's capable to
	listen to a local port and relay all traffic on it to certain remote/local
	address/port. The advanced functionalities includes:

		* Split upstream packet into packet-per-byte before relaying and vice
		versa.

		* Specify delays in forward/backward traffic relaying (delays are
		inserted every N bytes).

		* Force connection closing after forward/backward relaying traffic
		reached certain threshold (in bytes).

Synopsis
	You should first install Erlang which can be obtained from here:

		http://www.erlang.org/download.html

	Then you can run etcproxy by running it directly:

		$ ./etcproxy <local port> [<remote addr>:]<remote port>

	If <remote addr> is ignored, etcproxy will default to 127.0.0.1. Advanced
	options can only be turned on by modifying macros in etcproxy script for
	now, a more convinent command-line interface will be added soon.
